    "description": "Deciding what you want to eat and where you want to eat can be difficult choices to make. Especially when you’re hungry. Restaurantji has the largest database of restaurants across the US with over 500,000 places to eat, complete with all the information you need to help narrow down your decision in a matter of seconds. Don’t waste time with other restaurant searches that don’t give you the full story. Restaurantji gives you all the pertinent information you need from location details with addresses and phone numbers, as well as synced geolocation to find the restaurants nearest to your location. Restaurantji will even be sure to show you which restaurants are open now so you don’t waste time deciding on a place to eat only to arrive and find that it’s not open. And if you’re wondering if that new sushi place down the block is any good, Restaurantji aggregates all the customer ratings from other sites including Google, Yelp, Foursquare and TripAdvisor in order to list the best restaurants higher in the search results. That means that the results you get will be a list of the highest-rated dining experiences from food to service and beyond. "
